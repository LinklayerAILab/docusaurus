# LinkLayerAI Economic Model

## Economic Model Core Principles (Protocol Philosophy)

**1\. Data: Individual live trading data is a scarce asset.**

Users' real holdings and execution behaviors on DEXs and CEXs are the most authentic, least forgeable behavioral assets in Web3. Each piece of data carries behavioral value, risk value, and execution value—it not only records outcomes but also records traders' real decisions and risk exposure in uncertain markets.

**2\. Agent: Agents transform data into verifiable capability.**

LinkLayerAI's Agents are not centered on "opinion output" but on "continuous service around real holdings." Agents generate diagnostics, risk controls, and state judgments in service while continuously learning and calibrating from real market feedback. When Agents further execute trades transparently from independent wallets, their capability moves beyond the analytical layer to become execution facts observable and verifiable by the market, thus forming the basis for becoming prediction assets.

**2\. Incentive Closed Loop: Real Participation → Protocol Growth → User Returns.**

The economic model must ensure:

- Sustainability: Incentives rely not on infinite inflation but on real behavioral contributions and real fee/revenue sources.
- Growth Potential: As real data and usage grow, Agent capability and protocol value increase synchronously.
- Self-Consistency: Incentives are deeply bound to data access, service usage, transparent execution, and prediction participation.
- Alignment: The interests of users, Agents, and the protocol are aligned within the same closed loop.

Therefore, LinkLayerAI adopts a dual-token model:

**•** LLA: Governance + Protocol Value Capture (Primary Token) **•** LLAx: Ecosystem Behavioral Incentives + Utility / Agent Fuel (Secondary Token)

LinkLayerAI employs the LLA and LLAx dual-token economic system to achieve ecosystem growth incentives, value accumulation, buyback, and a long-term sustainable closed loop. This system consists of three core principles: Behavioral Incentives (LLAx) → Value Carrying (LLA) → Revenue Buyback, supplemented by a key "no-inflation distribution" entry point: prediction fee distribution in LLA.

## LLA: Protocol Value Accumulation and Governance Token

LLA is the core value and governance carrier of the LinkLayerAI ecosystem, representing the real economic foundation accumulated during the protocol's long-term operation.

Ecosystem revenues generated by the protocol (from Agent service fees, risk & data services, API licensing, prediction scenario fees, etc.) will enter a buyback mechanism via smart contracts to repurchase and burn LLA, making LLA the value anchor of the entire system. As ecosystem scale and revenue grow, LLA buyback intensity increases synchronously, forming a mechanism for continuous value concentration.

Simultaneously, LLA undertakes governance functions, serving as the governance credential for participating in key processes like ecosystem decisions, protocol upgrades, and parameter settings. LLA is not used for short-term behavioral rewards but focuses on the long-term duties of value carrying, revenue accumulation, and governance authority, making it the sovereign asset that ultimately captures value within the economic system.

## LLAx: Ecosystem Behavioral Contribution & Equity Token (Airdrop / Fuel)

LLAx is LinkLayerAI's behavioral incentive and contribution measurement token, used to quantify users' real participation in the ecosystem into redeemable equity. Its typical binding scenarios include:

**•** API Data Contribution & Verifiable Risk Events: e.g., After a user submits a read-only API, the system can analyze past six-month contract losses, liquidation/forced closure counts, etc., and issue LLAx accordingly; ongoing monthly statistics in the future form monthly incentives, creating a long-term structure for "data equity rewards." **•** Participation Feedback from Using Agent Services: When users pay to use holding services like Alpha/MemeRush/Perpetuals, they can also receive a certain percentage of LLAx feedback, used to improve retention and form continuous interaction, thereby feeding back into Agent learning. **•** Prediction Participation & Ecosystem Behaviors (Extended): Forming equity records around verifiable participation, avoiding purely narrative incentives.

LLAx is not positioned for market speculation but as ecosystem behavioral incentive and usage fuel, connecting the "Behavior → Equity → Value" path, allowing user participation to ultimately accumulate into protocol value.

## One-way Conversion Mechanism: LLAx → LLA (Conversion = Burn)

LLA and LLAx employ a strict one-way conversion design:

**•** LLAx → LLA: Convertible **•** LLA → LLAx: Not convertible

Conversion Principles:

**•** Users can convert LLAx earned through behavior into LLA. **•** After each conversion, the converted LLAx is permanently burned by the protocol (Burn). **•** The protocol dynamically manages the conversion ratio and can be adjusted according to ecosystem progress.

This one-way conversion ensures:

**•** Behavioral value flows one-way towards protocol value. **•** The total supply of LLAx continuously decreases with ecosystem growth (deflationary). **•** The value density of LLA continuously increases with conversion (value concentration). **•** Early contributors receive a higher weight for long-term returns.

This one-way conversion mechanism ensures:

- One-way flow of Behavioral Value → Ecosystem Value.
- The total supply of LLAx continuously decreases (deflation) as the ecosystem grows.
- The value density of LLA continuously increases (value concentration) through conversions.
- Early ecosystem contributors receive a higher weighting for long-term returns.

The mechanism's essence is: LLAx reflects contribution, LLA carries value; LLAx disappears upon conversion, LLA strengthens with ecosystem development.

## Buyback Mechanism:Real Revenue Supports Value Anchoring

LinkLayerAI's ecosystem revenue comes from:

**•** Agent invocation and service fees (modular services like Alpha/MemeRush/Perpetuals) **•** Data analysis and risk service fees **•** Third-party licensing and API calls **•** Prediction scenario fees, etc.

The protocol will automatically direct a certain proportion of revenue (determined by governance vote) into a Buyback Pool to execute public buybacks of LLA on DEXs. The repurchased LLA will be burned (Deflation) or injected into protocol value pools (e.g., Staking/DAO) to strengthen LLA's value foundation.

The buyback mechanism creates a positive cycle: The more the ecosystem is used → The higher the revenue → The stronger the buyback → The scarcer LLA → The more robust the value growth. This is the key design ensuring the entire economic system is supported by "real value."

## Prediction Fee Distribution (LLA): No-Inflation Distribution Entry Point (Key Supplement)

In LinkLayerAI's prediction scenarios, the asset is the verifiable performance of an "executable trading Agent." Platform fees generated by the prediction mechanism will be distributed to losing prediction participants in the form of LLA, used to hedge losses and enhance long-term participation fairness.

The key significance of this design lies in:

**•** The distribution of LLA originates from real fees, not released spontaneously, possessing an "inflation-free distribution" economic foundation. **•** Prediction moves from purely zero-sum towards a sustainable participation structure, promoting long-term consensus formation. **•** Distributed LLA can continue to be used to pay for or unlock Agent services, forming a "Prediction → Service → Learning" closed-loop backflow.

## Buyback Mechanism: Real Revenue Anchors Value

LinkLayerAI's ecosystem revenue is generated from:

**•** Fees from Agent invocation and services (modular services such as Alpha, MemeRush, Perpetuals) **•** Data analysis and risk service fees **•** Third-party licensing and API call charges **•** Prediction market platform fees, among others.

A predetermined percentage of this revenue, established through governance voting, is automatically channeled into a Buyback Pool. This pool is utilized to conduct public buybacks of LLA tokens on decentralized exchanges (DEXs). The repurchased LLA tokens are subsequently burned (creating a deflationary effect) or allocated to protocol value pools (e.g., for Staking or DAO governance), thereby reinforcing the fundamental value of LLA.

This buyback mechanism establishes a virtuous cycle:

Increased ecosystem activity → Higher protocol revenue → More aggressive buybacks → Greater LLA scarcity → More stable and sustainable value appreciation.

This design is central to ensuring the entire economic system is underpinned by tangible, generated value.

## Prediction Fee Distribution (in LLA): The Non-Inflationary Distribution Channel (Critical Enhancement)

Within LinkLayerAI's prediction markets, the core asset is the verifiable performance of an "Executable Trading Agent." The platform fees accrued from these prediction activities are distributed to participants on the losing side of a market in the form of LLA tokens. This serves to mitigate losses and encourage long-term, equitable participation.

The critical rationale behind this design is threefold:

**1\.** Economically-Sound Distribution: The LLA distributed originates from real fees collected, not from arbitrary minting, establishing an "inflation-free" distribution model with a solid economic basis.

**2\.** Fostering Sustainable Participation: It transforms prediction from a purely zero-sum game into a structure that incentivizes sustained engagement, thereby aiding long-term consensus formation.

**3\.** Creating a Closed-Loop Economy: The LLA received by participants can be reused within the ecosystem to pay for or access Agent services, creating a reinforcing "Prediction → Service → Learning" value cycle.

## Economic Model Summary

LinkLayerAI's economic architecture, built upon the dual-token framework of LLA and LLAx, creates a self-reinforcing positive cycle: "User Behavior → Earned Equity → Value Accrual → Buyback/Redistribution."

**1\.** Behavior Generates Equity (LLAx): Users' tangible contributions—through data sharing and service usage—are first quantified as LLAx equity, directly fueling ecosystem growth.

**2\.** Equity Converts to Value (LLAx → LLA + Burn): This LLAx can be converted into the value-bearing LLA token. The conversion process itself burns the LLAx, ensuring that incentives do not create immediate sell-side pressure but instead migrate into the long-term value layer, while the total supply of LLAx continuously decreases.

**3\.** Revenue Drives Value Appreciation (Buyback & LLA Distribution): As adoption of Agent services, data tools, and prediction mechanisms grows, the protocol generates increasing real revenue and fees. This triggers automated, smart contract-executed buybacks and burns of LLA, while the prediction fee distribution acts as a non-inflationary method for putting LLA into circulation, further strengthening its role as a value anchor.

In essence, LLA serves as the protocol's value capture and governance instrument, while LLAx functions as the behavioral incentive and utility fuel. Together, they constitute a sustainable, sell-pressure-resistant, highly incentivized dual-token economy grounded in real revenue.
