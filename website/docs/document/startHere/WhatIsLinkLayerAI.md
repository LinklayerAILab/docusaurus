# What Is LinkLayerAI

LinkLayerAI is an Agent-native protocol built around individuals' multidimensional live trading data. It aims to serve, model, and verify global traders' on-chain and off-chain live holdings through continuously operating Agents. This transforms real trading behavior from static records into intelligent infrastructure that can be understood long-term, executed transparently, and ultimately form market consensus.

## Multidimensional Trading Data

In LinkLayerAI, multidimensional data includes:

- Individual Live Trading Data: Exchange read-only API data (including Perpetuals contract positions, margin, liquidation levels, etc.) and on-chain address holdings and trading behavior (including spot activity such as Alpha and Meme assets).
- Public Trading Data: Public market signals such as market price feeds, on-chain liquidity and trading structures, funding rates, and volatility factors (used for contextual analysis and risk factor modeling).

Users can connect exchange read-only APIs or on-chain addresses to the system. The protocol automatically aggregates their real holdings, trading paths, and risk exposure, standardizing and aligning individual data with public market data. Subsequently, Agents operate continuously around users' "live holdings in progress": providing state interpretation and structural change alerts for spot positions, and offering risk control and risk boundary suggestions for contract positions, integrated with external factors. Unlike traditional tools, LinkLayerAI's core is not one-time analysis reports but continuous service and feedback centered on live positions.

## Core Outputs

Based on continuous comparison between live data and public factors, the system ultimately produces three core outputs:

**1\.** Position State & Risk Structure – Provides explainable state determination and risk boundaries for the user's current holdings (e.g., mid-cycle liquidity state for Alpha assets, short-cycle state machine for MemeRush, liquidation and drawdown structures for Perpetuals).

**2\.** Execution Debriefing – Identifies key points of success and loss based on real trading paths and market structural factors, forming traceable decision and execution attribution.

**3\.** Actionable Guidance – Offers executable risk control and position management suggestions based on the individual's real exposure and external factors, focusing on "constraints and boundaries" rather than emotional signals.

The goal of these outputs is to give traders, for the first time, a continuous "cognitive feedback loop": understanding what risks they are currently bearing, what phase they are in, and which variables are changing their position structure.

## Incentives and Value Assetization

LinkLayerAI refines users' live trading data and verifiable participation into measurable, referenceable, incentivizable units of value. Data collection, analysis, and verification happen off-chain, while value incentives and settlements are executed via on-chain smart contracts, ensuring transparency, fairness, and traceability.

Under this mechanism, users' real trading behavior is not only served and understood but can also generate stable value backflow at the protocol layer: users contribute real data and real risk exposure; the system continuously outputs service and feedback; the protocol provides equity rewards based on verifiable participation, and further forms a sustainable consensus closed loop in subsequent executable trading Agent and prediction scenarios.

## Three Core Assets

In LinkLayerAI, trading data is no longer just static historical records but is refined into three core assets:

**1\.** Understandable State & Risk Structure (State Asset) – An explainable mapping of your current holding's phase, liquidity structure, and risk boundaries.

**2\.** Serviceable, Evolvable Agent Capability (Agent Capability) – A trading Agent that operates continuously around real holdings, is debriefable, queryable, feedback-responsive, and continuously learns and self-calibrates during service.

**3\.** Verifiable Execution & Consensus Foundation (Verifiable Execution) – When an Agent executes strategies transparently on-chain from an independent wallet, its traceable trajectory becomes a market-verifiable factual object, laying the groundwork for forming market consensus and prediction assets.

## Goal & Vision

LinkLayerAI's goal is to build a new Web3 trading intelligence infrastructure: enabling every piece of live trading data to be served, understood, verified, and ultimately evolved into trading Agent consensus. In this system, trading intelligence no longer relies on narratives and authority but is rooted in real trading behavior, transparent execution, and long-term verification.
