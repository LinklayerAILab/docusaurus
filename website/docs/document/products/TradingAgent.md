# Trading Agent

## ——Executable Trading Agent: Learning, Evolution & Prediction Asset

## Product Overview

The Trading Agent is LinkLayerAI's third core product line and represents the narrative culmination. It is not a tool for users trade, but an executable trading entity that develops stable capability through long-term service and learning. Once it executes strategies transparently from an independent wallet on a DEX, forming a traceable record, it naturally qualifies as a prediction market asset.

## Core Capabilities

- Learning-in-Serving: The Agent's capability is not derived from backtest curves but from continuous calibration to real market behavior during its long-term service of actual holdings (Alpha/Perps).
- Transparent On-Chain Execution: Operates from a dedicated on-chain wallet, with all trading behavior publicly traceable and historically immutable.
- Verifiable Track Record: The market can independently observe its risk discipline, execution consistency, and performance under uncertainty, moving beyond narrative-based trust.
- Becoming a Prediction Target: The prediction object shifts from "price/event" to the "future performance of a verifiable trading entity," granting prediction markets greater fairness and a stronger consensus foundation.
- Economic Closed-Loop Interface: Prediction market fees are distributed to losing participants in LLA (a no-inflation distribution channel). This LLA can then flow back into the ecosystem via service consumption, completing the value loop.

Goal: To forge, for the first time, market consensus around "verifiable transaction capability," elevating predictions from information-based games to the pricing of competence.
