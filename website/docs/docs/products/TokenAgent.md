# Perps Agent (CEX Contract Holding Risk Control & Data Equity Reward)

## Product Overview

The Perps Agent targets "your real contract positions on centralized exchanges." After users grant read-only API access, the system delivers dual value:

- Real-time Perps risk control and actionable suggestions.
- Data equity rewards (LLAx) based on verifiable risk events.

## Core Capabilities

- Real-Time Position Monitoring: Reads critical contract position fields—direction, size, leverage, margin, liquidation price, unrealized P&L, funding rate, concentration—to form a real-time risk dashboard.
- External Factor-Integrated Risk Control: Assesses user positions by integrating public market factors (volatility shifts, funding rate crowding, liquidity contraction, abnormal liquidation signals) for structured risk evaluation and suggestions.
- Path Analysis & Failure Attribution: Transforms "losses, drawdowns, liquidations" from mere outcomes into analyzable paths, identifying key behavioral patterns and triggers that lead to risk accumulation.

## Data Equity Reward Mechanism

- Past Six-Month Retrospective Analysis: Compiles statistics on verifiable risk events from the past six months (e.g., count of liquidations/forced closures, loss-taking exits) to issue a one-time equity reward (LLAx).
- Future Monthly Statistics & Continuous Rewards: After integration, the system performs monthly rolling analyses of the above metrics to provide ongoing monthly LLAx rewards.
- Economic Utility Alignment: Earned LLAx can be used to pay for select platform services and is convertible to LLA via a strict one-way mechanism (conversion burns LLAx; LLA cannot be converted back to LLAx).

Goal: To transform contract risk from an unpredictable "accident" into a manageable "structure," and to turn real risk exposure into quantifiable equity.
