# Alpha Agent (Binance Alpha Asset Holding State Machine)

## Product Overview

The Alpha Agent targets "Binance Alpha tokens you already hold." It does not recommend new coins or perform broad market scans. It answers one core question: What is the current liquidity and structural state of your Alpha holding? Is the risk still manageable?

## Core Capabilities

- Holding State Machine (Mid-Cycle): Maps Alpha holdings to interpretable state phases (e.g., Accumulation, Acceleration, Contestation, Decay), providing users with "phase judgment" rather than information overload.
- Liquidity Structure Translation: Tracks key liquidity pool metrics—depth, concentration, slippage-sensitive zones, capital inflows/outflows, and key address activities—translating raw on-chain data into actionable portfolio insights.
- Risk Structure Alerts: Identifies variables that fundamentally alter a holding's structure (e.g., liquidity drainage, weakening buy-side support, key address transfers, capital structure shifts) beyond mere price noise and narratives.
- Push-Based Decision Support: Delivers "State Briefs" and "Risk Alerts" to help users base decisions on structural analysis rather than emotional reactions.

Goal: To elevate Alpha trading from "visibility" to "judgability."
