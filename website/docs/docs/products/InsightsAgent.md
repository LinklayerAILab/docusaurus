## Product Overview

**-Building Your “Trading Persona” with Deep Behavioral Intelligence**

The Insights Agent is the core analytical engine of the LinkLayerAI ecosystem. It leverages real trading-exchange API data and on-chain behavioral signals to model a user’s trading patterns, risk preferences, decision habits, strengths, and weaknesses—ultimately generating an evolving **Trading Persona**.

Rather than functioning as a simple analytics widget, the Insights Agent acts as a continuously learning, adaptive trading companion that understands the user’s behavior over time.

## Core Capabilities

**1\. Trading Persona Modeling**

The Insights Agent extracts key behavioral features across multiple dimensions, including:

- Profit/loss structure and win-rate models
- Order cadence, take-profit/stop-loss behaviors
- Leverage preferences and risk tolerance
- Performance across different market regimes
- Indicators of emotional trading (chasing pumps, panic selling, etc.)
- Strategy consistency and behavioral stability

These factors are synthesized into a visualized **Persona Profile**, functioning like a behavioral “DNA map” of the trader.

**2\. Personalized Behavioral Insights**

Based on the Trading Persona, the system generates tailored insights such as:

- Market conditions where the user performs best
- Common loss-making patterns
- Indicators that may trigger emotional decisions
- Personalized strategy suggestions and risk alerts
- Identification of harmful trading habits and structural risks

This level of insight goes far beyond what traditional trading tools can provide.

**3\. Strategy-Level Performance Analysis**

The Insights Agent automatically detects strategy patterns from historical trades and evaluates how each performs across phases and market conditions:

- Trend-following adaptability
- Breakout accuracy
- Grid/range strategy performance curves
- Stability of high-frequency or short-term strategies
- Yield differences under varying volatility regimes

Users gain a clear understanding of “what styles they are suited for—and which ones they are not”.

**4\. Persona-Driven User Experience**

The Trading Persona is not just an analysis output—it directly influences user experience across the ecosystem:

- Intelligent risk prompts
- Personalized strategy filtering
- Verified identity representation in community forums
- Weighting within the reward and ranking system

The Insights Agent defines “who you are” in the network, becoming the foundation for all downstream interaction.

<!-- part2 -->

LinkLayerAI provides a suite of strategy-oriented price analysis tools for traders, focusing on two core competencies: "Single-Asset Depth Analysis" and "Cross-Asset Real-Time Screening."

This is a non-custodial, execution-free analytical tool. We do not hold user funds, execute trades, or expose users to capital risk. We solely deliver clear, quantifiable market insights based on data computation.

## 1. Single-Asset: Multi-Timeframe Price Analysis (Spot & Futures)

Upon selecting any token, users access a price analysis dashboard powered by multi-source market data. All analysis is derived from the market itself, focusing on descriptive, structured indicators to help users quickly comprehend market state—not on providing price predictions.

The analysis encompasses:

**(1) Price Structure Analysis**

- Multi-Timeframe Trend Structure: Analysis of trend integrity and key levels across 1min, 5min, 1H, 4H, 1D, etc.
- Key Level Positioning: Current price relative to significant recent highs/lows, range midpoints, and critical breakout zones.
- Volatility Amplitude: Assessment of price movement ranges over the last 24 hours and 7 days.
- Relative Strength: Comparison of the token's performance and volatility against major market benchmarks.

**(2) Volume & Depth Characteristics**

- Volume Trend Analysis: Identification of increasing volume, decreasing volume, or anomalous volume spikes.
- Order Book Depth & Bid/Ask Ratio: Evaluation of market liquidity and buying/selling pressure.
- Capital Flow Features: Analysis of the ratio of aggressive buys vs. aggressive sells.
- Futures-Specific Metrics (if applicable): Long/short ratio, open interest changes, and liquidation cluster distributions.

**(3) Strategy-Oriented Indicator Presentation**

All technical indicators are presented solely to describe the current market state; the system does not generate trading signals or offer directional recommendations.

Supported classic indicators include:

- MA / EMA — for trend structure and alignment.
- MACD — for momentum and crossover positioning.
- RSI — for overbought/oversold zone assessment.
- Bollinger Bands — for volatility contraction/expansion analysis.
- KDJ, CCI, and other common oscillators.

All indicators are presented in a "Structure + Status" format, using plain language such as:

- "Price has been trading above the EMA20 for three consecutive days."
- "RSI is approaching overbought territory."
- "Bollinger Bands have sharply contracted, indicating volatility has dropped to a 30-day low."

This allows users to grasp the token's current market state through an intuitive, visual interface without needing to decipher complex technical parameters.

## 2. Cross-Asset: Real-Time Screening Engine (Full-Chain Filtering)

The second component is a real-time token screening system. Users can set custom strategy-based conditions to rapidly identify tokens across the entire market that meet their specific criteria. The system updates market data and refreshes the qualifying token list at near real-time speed.

Available Screening Conditions Include:

**(1) Trend-Based Conditions**

- MA crossovers (e.g., fast MA crosses above/below slow MA).
- MA alignment (e.g., bullish stack with short-term MAs above long-term MAs).
- Price breaking above/below defined range boundaries.
- Multi-timeframe trend confluence (e.g., 1H and 4H trends both bullish).

**(2) Momentum-Based Conditions**

- MACD golden/death cross.
- RSI entering/leaving overbought/oversold zones.
- KDJ bullish/bearish state.
- Momentum acceleration (e.g., MACD histogram expanding).

**(3) Volatility-Based Conditions**

- Price change ≥ X% (over 1H / 4H / 24H).
- Volatility expansion (e.g., Bollinger Band widening).
- Volatility contraction (e.g., Bollinger Band squeezing).

**(4) Volume-Based Conditions**

- Sudden volume spike (e.g., volume ≥ X times the 7-day average volume).
- Abnormal trading activity (significant volume surge in a short period).
- Sudden increase or decrease in futures open interest.

Users can combine multiple conditions to create complex queries, such as:

- 4H MA Bullish Alignment + MACD Golden Cross + Rising Open Interest
- 1H Price Increase > 3% + Volume Spike
- Bollinger Band Extreme Squeeze + RSI Returning to Neutral Zone

The screening results are displayed in a sortable, comparable token list that updates dynamically, empowering users to efficiently discover potential opportunities based on their predefined strategic logic.
