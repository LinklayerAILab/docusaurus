# What Is LinkLayerAI

LinkLayerAI is an intelligent incentive protocol built around multi-dimensional trading data. Its purpose is to analyze, model, and assetize real trading data from global traders through AI Agents, forming a scalable, open, and sustainable network of data value.

# **Multi-Dimensional Trading Data**

In LinkLayerAI, multi-dimensional data includes:

### **1\. Personal Live Trading Data**

Real exchange API data / on-chain trading behavior

### **2\. Public Market Data**

Market prices, orderflow, on-chain signals, sentiment indicators, liquidity factors, and more

Users can connect read-only exchange APIs or on-chain addresses. The protocol automatically aggregates their live trading records, behavioral patterns, and risk preferences. AI then structures this raw data, including:

- Strategy identification
- Behavioral pattern analysis
- Performance feature extraction
- Risk profiling
- Multi-dimensional persona modeling

# **Core Outputs**

Based on its analysis, the system produces three primary outputs:

**• Trading Persona**

A complete behavioral and strategic profile of the trader.

**• Loss Debriefing**

Identifying the root causes of losses based on actual trading actions and behavioral signals.

**• Personalized Insights**

Actionable optimization suggestions generated from the user’s live trading data and macro market factors.

By integrating personal and public datasets, the AI Agent builds validated behavioral profiles, risk maps, and strategy signatures. Social connections are no longer superficial or label-based; they naturally emerge from **actual performance, risk patterns, and strategic similarity**.

# **Incentives and Data Assetization**

LinkLayerAI distills each user’s trading data into a **measurable, referenceable, and rewardable value unit**.

Data collection, modeling, and verification occur off-chain through the AI system, while **value distribution and incentives are executed on-chain**, ensuring transparency, fairness, and traceability.

Under this mechanism, trading behavior is not only analyzed but also rewarded, forming a sustainable value loop.

# **Three Core Asset Forms**

Trading data in LinkLayerAI evolves into three fundamental asset types:

### **3\. Behavioral Model (Persona)**

A structured representation of trading style, emotional tendencies, and risk habits.

### **4\. Interactive Agent (Agent Interaction)**

A personal AI trained on your data—capable of analysis, Q\&A, debriefing, and continuous adaptation.

### **5\. Data Asset Layer (Data Assetization)**

Your trading data becomes a quantifiable, incentivized, on-chain asset class.

# **Mission & Vision**

LinkLayerAI aims to build a next-generation Web3 trading social network— one where every piece of trading data becomes **interpretable, interactive, collaborative, and valuable**, enabling traders worldwide to fully realize the value of their own data.
