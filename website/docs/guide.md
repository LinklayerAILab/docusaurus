## Security Best Practices

When configuring API keys for LinkLayer, please follow these security guidelines:

### Read-Only Permissions

- Always set API keys to **read-only** mode
- Never enable trading or withdrawal permissions
- This ensures LinkLayer can only view data, not execute transactions

### Key Management

- Store your API keys in a secure location
- Never share your API secret key with anyone
- Use unique API keys for different services

### Regular Monitoring

- Periodically review your active API keys
- Revoke unused or suspicious API connections
- Monitor your exchange account for any unusual activity

## Getting Started

Choose your preferred exchange from the sidebar and follow the detailed step-by-step instructions with screenshots to complete your API configuration.

If you encounter any issues during setup, please contact our support team for assistance.

## Important Notes

- All guides emphasize **read-only** API permissions for maximum security
- API keys created through LinkLayer guides cannot execute trades or withdrawals
- Each exchange may have different interface layouts, but the general process remains similar
- Screenshots in guides are for reference and may differ slightly from current exchange interfaces
